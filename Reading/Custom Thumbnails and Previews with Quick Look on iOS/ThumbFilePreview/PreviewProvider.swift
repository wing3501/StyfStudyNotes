     Use a QLPreviewProvider to provide data-based previews.
     
     To set up your extension as a data-based preview extension:

     - Modify the extension's Info.plist by setting
       <key>QLIsDataBasedPreview</key>
       <true/>
     
     - Add the supported content types to QLSupportedContentTypes array in the extension's Info.plist.

     - Remove
       <key>NSExtensionMainStoryboard</key>
       <string>MainInterface</string>
     
       and replace it by setting the NSExtensionPrincipalClass to this class, e.g.
       <key>NSExtensionPrincipalClass</key>
       <string>$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME).PreviewProvider</string>
